Project One Snake Game

## Overview:  
  I love snakes! For my first WDI project I created a classic arcade-style Snake game. In the game you control the direction of a snake and guide it toward food that appears in random places on the screen. When the snake eats the food, it grows longer. If the snake bumps into the wall or it's own body, the game ends. The game gets progressively more challenging as the body grows!

## Features To Add:
  I'd like to add a start button to begin and restart the game, as well as a "Game Over" screen so I can get rid of that        hideous alert.
